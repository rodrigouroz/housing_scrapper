# Housing scrapper

In my pursue of a new place to live, I was tired of having to remember which properties I've already checked, and also having to remember to go to the listings sites.

When I started bookmarking the queries I did in every listing site I realized what I was doing could be easily automated, and voil√†!

Meet housing scrapper, an app that queries the listings sites for you and notifies you over Telegram when a new property shows up. It remembers the one it notified you about so you won't receive the same property again.

This initial version is aimed at the Argentinean market, therefore there are only providers that list housing in Argentina.

I'd love to receive comments, bugs, ideas, suggestion (I don't use Python daily, please help me be more pythonic if you'd like to), etc. Hit me at rodrigouroz@gmail.com or file an issue in the repo.

## Instalation
This was tested with Python 3.8.

To install dependencies:

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

## Configuration

There's a `configuration.sample.yml` that you can use as a template for your configuration. Copy that file to a new one in the root folder and name it `configuration.yml`

You need to configure two aspects of the script: the listing providers and the notifier.

For the notifier you need to create a Telegram bot first: [Create a Telegram bot](https://core.telegram.org/bots)

Creating the bot will give you an authorization token. Save it for later, you'll need it.

A bot can't talk with you directly, you have two options: you talk to it first, thus allowing it to reply to you, or you can add it to a group. Whatever option you choose, you need to get the `chat_id` of either your account or the group.

After you've done either of the above, run this command script to find the `chat_id` (it will use your authorization token configured in configuration.yml):

```bash
python3 get_chat_ids.py
```

You'll see a list with an element, that's the `chat_id` you need to save for later. Write it down :-)

With the authorization token and the chat id you can now configure the notifier. Here's an example:

```yaml
notifier:
    refresh_command_messages:
      - 'Running your searches!'
      - 'You\'ve forced me to search and I will Obey'
    good_news_messages:
      - 'Hey, I have found new properties. Check them out:'
      - 'I hope it is lucky day today:'
    bad_news_messages:
      - 'Hmmm sorry, there no house today.'
      - 'Tomorrow will be a better day. Zero found.'
    enabled: true
    chat_id: <CHAT_ID>
    token: <TOKEN>
```

One down, one more to go. Now we need to configure the providers. For the sake of simplicity I'll include a sample, which I hope will be good enough:

```yaml
providers:
  zonaprop:
    base_url: 'https://www.zonaprop.com.ar'
    sources:
      - '/departamentos-alquiler-2-habitaciones.html'
      - '/ph-alquiler-2-habitaciones.html'
  argenprop:
    base_url: 'https://www.argenprop.com'
    sources:
      - '/departamento-alquiler-pais-argentina-2-dormitorios'
      - '/ph-alquiler-pais-argentina-2-dormitorios'
  mercadolibre:
    base_url: 'https://inmuebles.mercadolibre.com.ar'
    sources:
      - '/departamentos/alquiler/2-dormitorios/'
      - '/casas/alquiler/2-dormitorios/'
  properati:
    base_url: 'https://www.properati.com.ar'
    sources:
      - '/departamento/alquiler/ambientes:2'
  inmobusqueda:
    base_url: 'https://www.inmobusqueda.com.ar'
    sources:
      - '/departamento-alquiler-la-plata-casco-urbano.html?cambientes=2.'
  remax:
    base_url: 'https://www.remax.com.ar/listings'
    sources:
      - '/rent?page=1&pageSize=24&sort=%2Bid&in:operationId=2&in:typeId=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8&lte:price=70000&eq:currencyId=2&in:totalRooms=2,3&eq:cityId=25024&label=Capital%20Federal,%20Comuna%20Nro.%2014,%20%3Cb%3EPalermo%3C%2Fb%3E&filterCount=4&viewMode=list'
```

If you have issues with SSL certificates you can disable SSL validation with the attribute `disable_ssl`, by default it is enabled.

One final step, you need to initialize the database. Just run `python3 setup.py` and that's it. It will create a sqlite3 db file in the root folder.

You're all set. Now run `python3 crawl.py` and sit tight!

This will fill the database with new properties's data, now you need to run the notifier to get the telegram messages with info about newly scrapped properties, to do this just run: `python3 notify.py`

## Testing

Well, perhaps `testing` is a big word for this. You can run a module that tests that the providers configured can properly scrap information. If they work, you should see the listings in your console.

To test: `python3 -m tests`

## Running

That's up to you. What I've found more useful is to run it once an hour. For that I put it in the crontab:

For the crawler process:

`0 * * * * cd /<PATH_TO_PROJECT>/housing_tracker && python3 crawl.py >> crawler_runs.log 2>&1`

For the notifier process:

`0 * * * * cd /<PATH_TO_PROJECT>/housing_tracker && python3 notify.py >> notifier_runs.log 2>&1`

## Telegram Bot Commands:

The commands to be able to work you must run the listening daemon to run the daemon issue the following command:

`python3 listen_commands.py`

The available commands are the following (you can use this text as a BotFather command list):

```
/refresh - update properties and send notifications
/searches - show configured searches
/today - show last 24 hrs found properties
/more - notify about the next paged 10 unmarked properties
```

### Contribuiting:

To enable the debugger in the commands listener issue the following command:

`ENABLE_DEBUGGER=true python3 listen_commands.py`

### Refresh

Using /refresh command in your chat with the bot, it will manually trigger the configured searches ideal for anxious people.

## Troubleshooting

* If you receive an error from the telegram driver that states:

    "group chat was migrated to a supergroup chat"

    Then change the chat ID config in your configuration.yml file to the newly specified one
